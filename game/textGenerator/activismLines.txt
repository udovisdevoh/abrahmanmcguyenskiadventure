israel in 4 bc had no mass communication
israelis rule the heaven
israelites demand it freedom demanded
issue of a social life
it 's the liberation...
it across to any law
it ain't no country twang,
it ain't no rules in this game
it ain't your opinion
it all leads to me, independent and free
it bears to all exploitation
it breaks the system
it brings you to a state of natral high
it burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees
it calls it's name to the masses!
it can be feel the mass loss of humanity
it can erase the planet and there's
it can't be about material gain
it can't deserve to rule
it comes forth from heavy industry
it comes from the whole nation
it comes to execute it's rules
it costs less to buy it brand new
it could have been bit off in a struggle
it creeps through the veil of democracy
it determines the rules
it doesn't feel like freedom
it doesn't give you free integrity
it doesn't matter what state i'm in
it doesn't take a rebel to sing along.
it ended in the 2nd global war
it feels good to see freedom embraced
it feels good to see freedom excepted
it feels like there's no freedom
it felt good to be the rebel for the day
it gave me my brand new home
it gave you a mission
it got sold to our generation
it has always been my best company.
it has fallen by the nuclear knife
it has the power, makes the planet turn
it helps you to rule out the sorrow
it hovered above, i saw my order
it is a brand new day.
it is a struggle for existence
it is a tragedy, of this "democracy"
it is all a conspiracy
it is clearly a non human authority.
it is faster than your tv
it is for our generation
it is futile to resist
it is here (i will defend you)
it is just a different state of mind
it is justice not respect i'm after
it is money that rules the world,
it is my sheep they follow
it is religion in disguise
it is sincerely what rules our fears
it is the time to defend our motherland!
it is the voice called conspiracy
it is thy heritage to rule the world
it is time for a love revolution
it is time to conform
it is to maintain that overall system
it isn't hard to get an education
it keeps her company
it keeps us oppressed
it kisses moroth in his freedom flight
it leads us to order
it locks so nice on the tv screen
it looks like an invisible planet
it looks like the system
it looks like you need some company
it made all the rights wrong
it made me brand new again
it makes no sense for us to be pawns
it makes up its own rules
it makes up your opinion more than once
it may surprise the majority
it might cause a riot
it might strike up a riot
it might use during an armed revolt.
it must be a cool state of mind
it must be law exploding all the balls
it must be now, we must revolt
it must be the influence of society
it must be the rebel in me
it never ceases this struggle, this pain
it never was too easy to rule
it oughta be against the law.
it overcomes in justice
it pays to brake the law
it probably don't seem like a struggle
it rejoins the final blaze disorder
it representin the struggle man.
it rights the imbalance of fire
it rules in the hearts of millions
it rules me, drags me into black
it rules them ,you will see
it runs right though our society
it sang like freedom calls
it saturates the system
it screams out for freedom
it seems everybody has a social sect
it seems like freedom
it seems she needs to oil her spine
it shall reap the survivors
it shares to you and you cannot resist
it shook me and questioned my integrity
it should be a law against me and you
it spills across the factory floor.
it spreads disease where freedom rings
it suits the laws written
it takes a slanted state of mind
it takes away your freedom
it takes manifest in this,
it takes more than ooo material things
it takes your freedom from you
it time for generation
it violates old laws, repeals all orders
it vomits sticky oil on me
it was a conspiracy!
it was a masonic conspiracy
it was against the law
it was all combed out with the system up
it was all in the great state parks
it was for our rights our ancestors died
it was last week we were watching tv
it was made by my order
it was no place for justice
it was sealed by a mechanical movement
it was sold to the sly nation
it was struggling with darkness
it was the beginning of my empire
it was the struggle of the century,
it was the summer of the riots
it was them - who made the rules
it was to bring a total mass hysteria
it was you, bringing your white company
it will be mine to corrupt
it will be revolution
it will go on forever, your power i defy
it will not desist until i manifest
it will start up a riot 'n'
it won't be an uphill struggle
it would be folly to defy the eldest law
it would go up against every rule
it's 1969 ok all across the usa
it's 7am on a brand new day
it's a billion dollar industry
it's a brand new age
it's a brand new day
it's a brand new feel
