but a few warriors decide to resist
but a mission lies right ahead of us
but a mission you should undertake
but a money making cog, built to fuel the corporate greed

but all is lost into the hands of politics
but all it is, is a nazi nation!!!
but all my troubles and my justice fades on such cold steel
but all that they found beyond their system
but all you got is another struggle and no one's gonna lend you a hand

but as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
but as hard as we may buck, the king of fools is still in place and fit to rule
but as it is my state of mind
but as long as i'm your president you better learn to pray

but brutus couldn't resist the knife
but buddy you've taken the nation
but by strong folk, not a puppets feeble imitation
but calling it freedom
but can it be i miss their company, need their guidance and advice to define
but can they find verdicts on me while they're corrupt like...
but can we begin to imagine tyranny with no end?
but can we speak of freedom
but can we truly be free of tyranny and grief?
but can you resist the seducing forces
but can't defy gravity
but can't remember  the city or state
but can't remember the city or state
but can't you see the crimes that religion does?
but carrying so much resistance from behind
but chaos rules, they come from outta space
but come the revolution you'll be first against the wall
but come thru, show me love and i'll defend you (owh!)
but committing crimes in order to score, now what do you expect?
but complicated answers never did you any justice anyway
but considering that in this state that i thought this night
but corporate america, and billion dollar industries
but corporate america, that's what they sold us
but corruption has a chance
but could i really be the one to resist that kiss so true
but could you face mass condemnation.
but country never did anything for me
but courage, craft and justice
but decadence grows in your soul
but deep inside i always knew your system sucks and so do you
but destiny's a state of mind
but didn't defend himself
but do the governments really care
but do you vote or do you only complain
but do you wanna fight for your country?
but do you wanna vote
but do you wanna vote for your conscience?
but does the justice have the right to be unkind?
but don't believe what they say, because your government is lying
but don't blame them: the brainwashed minds
but don't change your self for society
but don't get me wrong, perform my mission
but don't think you don't have company
but don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
but dont have the strength, this mass ocean
but each new movement pushes up an old lie
but earl walked right through that restraining order
but equality can't be built in a day
but even now i can't resist
but even the president of the united states
but even your company must complement.
but everybody turns you to tv wife, everybody turns you to tv wife
but everyone asks you for your public opinion
but everyone's looking at tv screens
but existing to resist was lost somehow
but exploitation and murder.
but fate rules the game of insatiable lust, notorius wandering eye
but fewer roads to get a brand new start
but first there is the law of cromwell.
but for chips and for freedom
but for liberty we'll ride
but for now we must defend
but for state,country,national church
but for the masses our of sight is out of mind,
but found it hard to keep it up when you were changing rules
but freedom and glory make them see the light
but freedom creates an illusion
but freedom it's the reason now
but freedom never dies!!!
but freedom of speech won't feed my children
but fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
but give us freedom once and for all
but global revolution never seemed to show its face
but go and get it back, and do revive it's state.
but government, it wants the same
but greed and power seem to rule!!!
but guilty is just what justice is in need of
but haven't won the pagan resistance
but having strung eyes of oppose, here we go
but he could not resist the call
but he got the revolution cough
but he got to stay stronger and keep the struggle alive.
but he hears without fear what they state
but he rules also those creatures
but he trusts in the rule of law and hates the current scapegoats.
but he was shot, the law was faster
but he will never be indicted for his crimes against this nation
but he wont say that in his dream state he crashes in the woods
but he'd sing for the masses if he just had the time
but he'll put you in the state penitentary, he'll put you in the federal
but he's stronger than a country hoss
but her power will defy you when she wears her heart on her sleeve
but here come your rules
but here i am mesmerized
but his ass is such a puppet
but his friends are telling him he's buying into the patriarchal system
but his opinion disturbs me
but house rules sure were not fun
but how can i defend you now?
but how can offer resistance to you in my head ?
but how could i start fresh and join upright society?
but human to human as we struggle to understand
but i ain't gonna be oppressed by you
but i am better company
but i am no fool's, oh don't break the rule
but i be out with my peeps in them system jeeps
but i beat the system everywhere i goes
but i been struggling ever since i moved to a new school
but i believe in revolution
but i believe that love is law in our world
but i can't leave my tv set at all - i'll go into withdrawal
but i can't pretend i don't need to defend some part of me from you
but i can't resist myself
but i can't resist the temptation search for my soul to leave it all behind
but i can't resist you
but i can't resist myself
but i cant wait for this freedom to go away
but i could give a fuck about this industry
but i could never stand and judge like you, i resist so i am free.
but i could not do them justice, so i hung up and fell back to sleep.
but i could not resist it
but i could relate to the state i was in when i thought about discrimination
but i coulda been a lawyer, i shoulda been a doctor
but i couldn't resist
but i couldn't resist the temptation
but i couldn't resist a little adolescent bragging
but i defy you to see through me
but i didn't let go without struggle
but i do't hang out with stars and if i need money i'll just pawn a few guitars
but i don't believe in the factory
but i don't care about their rules
but i don't choose the company i keep and it shows.
but i don't ever see you with any security,
but i don't give a damn about a media jones
but i don't have a choice unless a revolution
but i don't like mcdonalds they always mess up my order
but i don't qualify i never helped to write the rules
but i don't subscribe to the state that we're living it
but i don't wanna hear you defend them
but i don't wanna live in a 2nd usa
but i don't wanna up and leave cause of something that the media says (aww yeah)
but i don't want you society, fuck a culture that rejects me
but i feel powerless to resist
but i follow my fucking law
but i follow my own law
but i found my salvation in peron, may the nation
but i found strength in the struggle
but i got a brand new pair of shoes
but i got it back today in a velvet box stamped usa
but i got my eye on a country mile
but i got the drop, and outside, rule got the drops
but i got two bedrooms and a brand new oven
but i gotta survive in order to follow thru plans to live lot-o
but i guess it's the only freedom that you've ever known
but i had to have some company
but i have found it helps this state of disarray
but i have learned to be a king and to rule the legion
but i just changed the rules
but i just want to see the planet before i die
but i keep fighting and i'm finding your injustice
but i kinda like the company...and i guess
but i know (i like people) i'm not you (to break rules)
but i know i can hear the revolution calling
but i know my rights babe
but i know that it's useless to maintain this state of hopelessness
but i know that tomorrow i will look upon the final remains of my empire,
but i know the rules
but i live by another set of rules and i know jsut what it takes to prove
but i lost my resistance
but i love this city, this state
but i make a lot of deliveries to government offices
but i move, like the president through town
but i must obey laws
but i never understood who even made the rules
but i only see corruption
but i question you integrity
but i remember a revolution song
but i remember the revolution song
but i remember you when you loved freedom too
but i resist the exorcist
but i sat and opened in no certain order
but i saw a need on my big screen tv
but i stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
but i stay on a mission, i'm on the grind
but i tell you, justice ain't merely blind
but i think your words were corrupted by love,
but i wanted to start my life brand new
but i was a fool playing by the rules
but i was smart and i quit school, started smoking, breaking rules
but i wasn't meant to burn out in some factory
but i will break...the laws of time
but i will destroy a system that's build on greed
but i won't be corrupted
but i won't conform to your society
but i won't let them take what is left of my freedom
but i wont conform to this sillines,
but i worry 'bout what kids learn from tv
but i'd like to stay in and watch tv on my own, every now and then
but i'd rather be a king of nothing than a servant in a sick society
but i'll be damned if i'll ride rice, made in the usa.
but i'll break their rules
but i'll remember the religion
but i'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
but i'm a man with a mission tonight
but i'm a victim of society
but i'm branded forever lame
but i'm just like you, flesh and blood, in need of revolution.
but i'm not alone anymore. my vein rivers of pollution, injected harmony. i no
but i'm not much company for long
but i'm not the only one with name brand shoes on,
but i'm sick of you all, and i'm sick of opinions,
but i'm still in the bathtub so if you got cattle you best be fasting
but i'm struggling to find a balanced flow
but i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
but i'm to defy, i have to ignore her cry
but i'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk
but i's told him he could make it up by fixing the tv,
but i've been corrupted.
but i've found some brand new arms,
but i've given up my rebellion
but i've got the company car
but i've taken up a brand new fight
but i, i, i, i defend it
but if he aint got nuclear weapons he should keep on runnin'
but if he's mad at a country
but if i lived my life by my own rules
but if i vote against it
but if we don't stand against oppression we might as well embrace it
but if you insist well if you can't resist
but ignorance and arrogance rule the grounds
but ill order it from zanzibar
but im stuck here with me own company
but imagined his son a lawyer or broker,
but in a society so sick
but in life you can't press rewind
but in my acts and deeds i'm a political man
but in my eyes you rule the world
but in my humble opinion
but in my opinion this is hardly enouth.
but in my opinion you can fuck the whales and save yourselves
but in my state of blind confusion
but in my state of mind i let him make his play
but in order that the world might be saved through him,
but in order to have my victory
but in order to have my victory-i gotta believe-ooh yeah!
but in order to live we still suffer on.
but in response our nation does nothing but lie
but in subvert city, it's subvert rule
but in the end corruption still exists
but in the end i can't defend you.
but in the end is liberty guranteed?
but in the end the 7 families rule them all
but in the harsh reality, you're a media tool
but in the stars and closer to home, in every planet
but in the state of stagnation, only quality will prevail.
but in this country, society itself is failing.
but in this night the red wine rules in me
but in this world exists the law
but is security after all a cause
but is this freedom just another hand from which we feed?
but it ain't for revolution, it's just for cash
but it can't fight your resistance
but it don't always follow the rule no
but it fuels the economy, so i'm glad he had it
but it guards the ancient empire
but it is me, left here, to struggle through the night...
but it is not our nation state that needs to be saved
but it means don't hang yourself on a material life
but it only held enough oxygen
but it only increases your welfare check
but it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
but it was just an order of fries
but it was just the tv
but it's - one nation indivisible
but it's against the law to jump off this bridge
but it's all bollocks to me i'm like to smash my tv
but it's always the law
but it's attempts to rule the body is doomed to fail
but it's gotta be pumpin' in order for me to get cream
but it's just the empire of a new master race
but it's my country too
but it's not my fault, i'm just following your fucking stupid rules
but it's only a minority in authority
but it's president (geeoorrggiiaa) bush
but it's sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
but it's the best soap on tv
but it's the jo that's country
but it's this one rule

it goes to show you can't resist the fatal blow
it got sold to our generation
it had to be from the heart in order to be reality
it has always been my best company.
it has been optimized to run on any system
it has fallen by the nuclear knife
it has its own justice and my dreams are languid and lawless. and everything
it has the power, makes the planet turn
it has to be based upon one's own rules and values.
it has to be objective in order to be discussible.
it has to do with freedom and personal liberty
it helps you to rule out the sorrow
it hovered above, i saw my order
it hurts when they press and they won't let you rest
it inpires men to stand up for their rights
it is a brand new day.
it is a citizen's duty to resist the system that pits us against one another
it is a law that depends only on mutation and evolves itself rapidly
it is a struggle for existence
it is a tragedy, of this "democracy"
it is all a conspiracy
it is an exposition of opinions and it's the blind leading the blind
it is at the magnitude of daily murders, massacres and mass graves
it is clearly a non human authority.
it is fantasy freedom; tied to galleys we row
it is faster than your tv
it is for our generation
it is futile to resist
it is here (i will defend you)
it is how your people crushed the country thoughtlessly down
it is just a different state of mind
it is justice not respect i'm after
it is money that rules the world,
it is more than just a phrase, fighting for my rights
it is my sheep they follow
it is only area to which the council can communicate with this planet.
it is probably that an all out nuclear war
it is real as anything the system has made
it is religion in disguise
it is sincerely what rules our fears
it is sweet and meet fitting to die for ones country.
it is the art of could balance the movement
it is the dawn in which the underdog finds the strength to rebel
it is the joy of contributing to the planet
it is the time to defend our motherland!
it is the triumph of the blasphemous masses
it is the voice called conspiracy
it is the voice of government speaking to ignorance
it is thy heritage to rule the world
it is time for a love revolution
it is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
it is time to conform
it is time to rearrange, time for a protest movement
it is time! we shall rule, and upon our dominion the sun shall never set!
it is time, it is time, for a love revolution
it is to maintain that overall system
it is your corrupt we claim. it is your evil that will

it justifies, nas escobar's leavin shit mesmerized
it keeps her company
it keeps me from falling into another state of mind
it keeps us locked in our submissive state
it keeps us oppressed
it kills to be dishonest but you're not an exception to the rule
it kisses moroth in his freedom flight
it leads us to order
it left a hole in me as black as night, just a pawn in their charade
it locks so nice on the tv screen
it looks a lot like engine oil and tastes like being poor and small
it looks like a revolution but it's only the truth
it looks like an invisible planet
it looks like the system
it looks like you need some company
it looms and towers over me like the statue of liberty
it loved this terror and sent bloodhounds into the country
it made all the rights wrong
it made me brand new again
it makes me feel uncomfortable like there's a lack of equality
it makes me sick, the thought of it - your filthy exploitation
it makes no sense for us to be pawns
it makes up its own rules
it makes up your opinion more than once
it manifest in chaos -destroying all in it's path -this pulverizing
it may surprise the majority
it might cause a riot
it might strike up a riot
it might use during an armed revolt.
it must be a cool state of mind
it must be a riot if they're calling for backup
it must be law exploding all the balls
it must be now, we must revolt
it must be the influence of society
it must be the rebel in me
it must be tough when society is messed up
it never ceases this struggle, this pain
it never was too easy to rule
it never works but we keep tryin' like fools learning and breaking the rules
it only gives you power and power makes the rules.
it only takes one break of a pose to get oil
it oppressed the masses... minds are admires...
it oughta be against the law.
it overcomes in justice
it pays to brake the law
it probably don't seem like a struggle
it rejoins the final blaze disorder
it reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system
it representin the struggle man.
it rights the imbalance of fire
it rules in the hearts of millions
it rules it's reign, i pray for the end of time,
it rules me, drags me into black
it rules my mind, your spirit haunts me time and time again.
it rules them ,you will see
it rules your judgement on what is false or true
it runs right though our society
it sang like freedom calls
it saturates the system
it screams out for freedom
it seems everybody has a social sect
it seems like freedom
it seems like he got the whole country behind him
it seems my brand new candles would catch on fire today
it seems she needs to oil her spine
it seems so futile, forgiveness, your freedom
it seems that they just wanted to make an alternative society
it seems that your mission is to blind-fold the crowd
it seems to me simple, just strive for mental freedom,
it seems to me simple, just strive for mental freedom, don't end up =
it seems to me the time is right, for another generation
it seems to me you want to rule all over me
it seems you're always looking for a new religion
it shall reap the survivors
it shares to you and you cannot resist
it shocked her system from within  so she lies staring at the images inside
it shook me and questioned my integrity
it should be a law against me and you
it slayed him self in devotion and resistance
it snowballs into worthless pawns, multiplying, buying
it so fresh out da press, grey goose on the rocks..
it spills across the factory floor.
it spreads disease where freedom rings
it spreads its revolution wide from cell to cell to cell
it started many years ago, out of the black country
it suits the laws written
it takes a nation of millions to hold me back
it takes a slanted state of mind
it takes away your freedom
it takes manifest in this,
it takes more than a shout for a tyrant to get down
it takes more than ooo material things
it takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker
it takes your freedom from you
it time for generation
it took no time to blend in, with the population prison
it took the agenda from its place in my bed
it took three damn days for the mission man
it violates old laws, repeals all orders
it vomits sticky oil on me
it was a conspiracy!
it was a different place, a different state
it was a masonic conspiracy
it was a new generation, aiming for eternety
it was a private institution in the name of punk-rock
it was a summer night by the mass ave bridge
it was a tribute to a fallen brother and from across the nation
it was against the law
it was all combed out with the system up
it was all different people livin on the planet
it was all in the great state parks
it was as if the entire population had suddenly gone underground
it was black freedom day, a prayer and a hope
it was clear why the struggle was so painful
it was clearly a mission for the comfort of the road
it was for our rights our ancestors died
it was last week we were watching tv
it was made by my order
it was my belief that even the minorities, had a valid voice in our society
it was no place for justice
it was sealed by a mechanical movement
it was simple propaganda to connect with the new humans
it was sold to the sly nation
it was something wrong and then i marched towards the authority
it was struggling with darkness
it was that institution as your last solution
it was the beginning of my empire
it was the company you kept, the many places you slept
it was the greatest funeral, i laid in perfect state
it was the mighty empire fallen from grace
it was the old rock and roll under brand new control
it was the struggle of the century,
it was the summer of the riots
it was the time we cried for justice loud
it was them - who made the rules
it was to bring a total mass hysteria
it was you, bringing your white company
it will be mine to corrupt
it will be revolution
it will go on forever, your power i defy
it will make the silver chords, the state of all
it will never measure up to what tv sells as great
it will not desist until i manifest
it will press me off again to the daylight
it will start up a riot 'n'
it won't be an uphill struggle
it works within the system and they won't understand
it would be blatantly naive to expect a new society overnight,
it would be blatantly naive to expect a new society overnight, but =
it would be cool just to be in your company
it would be folly to defy the eldest law
it would be his throne room where he'd rule
it would go up against every rule
it'll be standard procedure across the nation

it's been a real struggle
it's been a struggle and you weren't there for us
it's been a struggle for me,
it's been a struggle for the past few nights
it's been begging for forgiveness after laying down the law
it's been illusive for so long but freedom is mine today
it's been up and down the country roads
it's better to struggle than to take the easy way out
it's bigger than cold religion
it's bigger than you and the welfare state
it's book review and face the nation time
it's branded into my soul
it's breaking ice.. now, to make any movement
it's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
it's call it religion

it's detox tv here at noon
it's easier to fake and smile and bribe
it's easy to beat the system,
it's either me or that tv
it's essential cuz the record company will have your ass in a rental
it's every man for himself a chaos of mass rioting
it's everything assuring, it's national unyeilding security
it's evident who's out for the dead president
it's evident, your ass lie like the president
it's exploitation on you soul but do you really care
it's failed my generation
it's fit for the masses, divided by classes

it's hard enough to remember my opinions without remembering my reasons for them
it's hard not to be a menace to society
it's hard ta be me, like them stunts on tv, g
it's hard to be free when our sick society is caught in the act
it's hard to beat the system
it's hard to believe that you have a brand new life, while mine i take in stride

it's hopes taken, freedom is agreed
it's how many lives snuffed outside of the law.
it's immoral to encourage others to accept injustice you do not endure,
it's impossible given the incident, given his catatonic state
it's in man's nature to react according to and against these structures.
it's in me and i can't resist it
it's in my hands to rule and command
it's in the brand of your clothes

it's not working and the rules have already changed
it's not worth fighting, just resist
it's nothin, i'm from new york but i got country cousins
it's nothing but facism, capitalism, and fear
it's nothing more than a political weapon
it's nothing new to break the rules and be a suicide
it's now 3:21 pm on the planet demon8
it's now become a struggle for the middle-class to survive
it's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat

it's one of nature's laws
it's one struggle - it's one fight
it's one struggle, one fight
it's only another obstacle blocking any chance of equality

it's our generation that ought to feel shame
it's our generation, baby
it's our generation, yeah
it's our last chance to defend
it's our lasting liberty-the freedom to succumb,
it's our mission to seek our enemies and kill them one by one
it's our nation, we were living for the day
it's our prison, final reason for the freedom and the glory that we feel
it's our responsibility to keep the system working
it's our rights they're abusing, it's our right to fight back
it's our time to make a stand against the rule of the skeleton crown.
it's over race, religion, colours and creeds
it's over when we're afraid to break the rules
it's overwhelming, the state of mind we're in
it's own god, it's own religion
it's packaged! it's just fashion and rebellion
it's paranoia time and it's time to break the rules
it's part of yo struggle if it you ain't got shit for me

it's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
it's succumbed to its own laws
it's such a brutal planet
it's such a long time since the towns flourished. and it was a fertile country
it's sunday morning and like sheep with no shepherd
it's sunday morning and you struggle with the sheets
it's superficial progress, they call it liberation
it's sure time to party when your freedom comes,

it's that old time religion
it's the aim of existence to offer resistance to the flow of time
it's the american in me that makes me watch tv

one brick thrown, one vote alone
one by one they fall; to ensure, liberty
one by one they met their fate in the boiling oil
one can't breathe while choked with puppet strings
one city barren wasteland, a split-second blaze
one crisis after another
one dares oppose. control.
one day he'll know the taste of freedom.
one day i am going to invent a new drug disconnect from the system just unplug.
one day i realise oil on canvas
one day i won't have to fear a cop, or a security guard what a dope beat drop.
one day i'll be there fighting for the usa
one day in a nuclear age
one day justice will come and find you
one day one will pay, justice all will see.
one day our generation
one day patriotic thugs will dance to songs of justice
one day soon we'll rule the nation
one day this empire will be discovered
one day thrown in jail for breaking religious rules
one day we'll sing our freedom
one day your system will collapse
one day, one day, freedom will be legalized.

the lifespan of the planet is just a glimmer then its gone
the light brings liberty to you
the light fades up in a brand new heart
the light of freedom shines so bright ahead
the light of liberty will forever shine
the light of those who oppose me!!!!
the light won't shine over your holy empire
the lightening flashes through the wasteland
the lighthouse of life think that rule

the lust for freedom will see me through, until i break the chain,
the lusts are your rules
the lying government

the majority lack one, but its not about backbones
the majority of ears were only being polite
the majority of our kin left this world to begin anew.
the majority of people are treated like shit
the majority of these boys in blue are phony
the making over requires and order for some surgery
the man at hand that rule the school

the man next door? your brother in law? who's away working on the oilrigs?
the man of the struggle,
the man on the tv is all you need to see
the man on tv preaches his beliefs to me
the man said to cop religion alls i wan't is peace
the man the authorities came to blame
the man was an icon of generation x
the man who avoids the rules of life
the man who rules the world
the man who spends his life on a mission, he's legendary
the man's gunna laugh as your resistance he breaks
the manifest of a change slain

the mass of people touches my frozen soul
the mass of praying corpses
the mass of steel begins to rust...
the mass of the primitive oceans
the mass of times, the highpriest's return
the mass requires rotten blood
the mass thought will not survive
the mass was celebrated at a place of blood and destruction
the mass was created in a spirit of greed and corruption
the mass was shouting
the mass will never see
the masses air becomes thicker than the water we drink people unaware
the masses are armed
the masses are asses, a bunch of fools
the masses are eager to follow and to join up with the legions of lies"
the masses are gathered, to watch me as i slip away
the masses are going to battle
the masses are left to ponder
the masses are marching northward.
the masses are numb, their ethics awry.
the masses are obsequious, contented in their sleep
the masses are starving while ministers dine
the masses are swallowed under,
the masses ascend to a golden lie
the masses bewildered, the marked ones avoided
the masses cheer i climb the stairs
the masses cheer, to hide their fears
the masses cling to fallacy without the courage to feeling another way
the masses comatose.
the masses consumed by this culture of greed
the masses cringe in fear for their sentence has arrived
the masses feel good
the masses flee the abyss in awe.
the masses from a distance
the masses gather 'round
the masses gather for another look
the masses have been hypnotized
the masses have fallen.
the masses have grown
the masses have taken them
the masses hinged on the stroke of a knife.
the masses inside of us suffering they are bleeding,

the masses of sleepers fear it in part on account of these historical examples
the masses of unscarred.

the masses slave it while the masters feast.
the masses that teem below them
the masses they can't relate
the masses they decide the fate of a fallen men.
the masses walk towards the oppressive warmth of the fire.
the masses watch and stand by
the masses were assured, she fought without a sword.

the stench of death in every nation,
the stench of global furnace
the stench of mass complacency
the stiller the oxygen the harder you breathe
the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law
the sting of dejection nestled in conformity
the stock market falling, while the corporations are sawing
the stone is inscribed with "law", but the "law" conflicts with virtue
the stones of freedom
the storm lit the struggle of the dark powers against death...
the storm rules in the air
the story begins. the revolution comes
the strain of security will lead your steps into this world
the strange pain press heart with cold
the strangle hold of society

the structures, the colors
the struggle - for survival - a stupid aim
the struggle ain't right up in your face, it's more subtle
the struggle and sacrifice.
the struggle and the fight
the struggle appear to be infinite
the struggle continues
the struggle continues as the cries of pain
the struggle continues at the of pain
the struggle ends up here!

the struggle goes on but less than all
the struggle has yet to begin
the struggle in my mind
the struggle inside is pathetic
the struggle inside makes me torn.
the struggle inside of your mind is a waste of time - purest thoughts evaporate
the struggle is beautiful, i'm too strong for your slavery
the struggle is imminent
the struggle is in our hearts, it's in our hands
the struggle is never-ending
the struggle it don't stop until we drop

the struggle of a birth
the struggle of forces the struggle of the unknown
the struggle of just being us..black maybe
the struggle of just being you
the struggle of our true emotions passive is the one
the struggle of so many years, all the pain, all the tears
the struggle of the ancients first began
the struggle of the races continues on the scene.
the struggle of the soul
the struggle of the tyrants
the struggle of these years
the struggle tears me apart
the struggle that never ends.
the struggle that will send the powers,
the struggle that your caught up in

the struggle will go on as long as you keep fighting
the struggle with yourself
the struggle within archaic desire, claim your right and devour
the struggle you've been into
the struggle's about freedom, not who is going to win it
the struggle, baby, has just begun
the struggle, my great grand who lived thru the linchin'
the struggle, the battle, the fight for time
the struggling layman, the lazy lush
the struggling of finding the truth behind the lies
the struggling souls, seeking the spirit
the stuff for modern media lore

the sun doesn't admit me in his empire,
the sun falls on my eyes and i'm struggling to reason why everybody smiles
the sun is shining on a brand new day
the sun never sets on the empire won
the sun turned cold over president street and the town of the brooklyn mourned
the sun will never rise, darkness will rule supreme.
the sun will rise up, and you'll be in freedom
the suppression of each generation
the supreme state is death
the surface of the planet. the shape of the stars
the surprise is part of the movement,
the survival structures of my soul
the survivors are numbered amongst the dead
the survivors are suffocated by the reek of spoilage
the survivors might see the night
the survivors of a dead world,
the survivors of the battle against chaos to one final act of defiance...
the survivors searching for the light
the swan song of a nation,
the swan was in her movement
the swarming infected mass discovered
the sweat of the industry secret handshake
the sweet tv with the vcr

the system makes sure that the boot goes in
the system malfunctioning
the system medicates them
the system might have got you but it won't get me
the system mounted on the wall
the system moves to slow

the tears they pave my indoctrination
the teeming masses can't be killed with bullet
the templars become rich in order to purchase the world
the temptations so hard to resist
the tenebrous architectural rules of
the terrorist religions and their bullshit lines, of all the hand-me-

will you defend your life
will you feel the power from my empire, the first supper
will you fight for freedom, will you fight for justice
will you fight for your agenda
will you help me fulfill this mission that lies ahead
will you indoctrinate the masses to serve your new regime?
will you just watch as the cattle trucks roll by?
will you need that kind of freedom
will you reach out if you can't resist?
will you remember the old rule?
will you stand and defy me or shatter and fall
will you stand in line while the shepherd hunts his sheep?
will you stand up for democracy?
will you talk of freedom when the blood begins to run?
will you... like a thoughtless puppet...

your rules won't work for me
your rules, your race
your sap will touch freedom and shed away relics.
your scared seductive system
your scholarship into the world of politics
your scream "fuck the system" but you're the systems tool
your security is drowned in that self-indulgent frown
your self-destructive belief system is a festering cancer
your self-destructive society,
your self-interest is higher than the welfare of the world
your self-righteousness is corrupted by your tendencies to avoid your lies
your senility reflects your dying religion

your system overloads again.
your system torn from the straps of the gods
your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror i behold.

your taste for pure freedom
your teaching is a scam for the money you hold
your temptations i try to resist them
your the first to turn state
your thoughts are corrupted with deceit
your thoughts are law, great dragon.
your thoughts are ours to manipulate.
your time is spent, the day is done, your struggle is gone
your tongue is a bush bucket of drama
your touch shattered all resistance
your tribute to freedom
your true religion was a knife
your turn is next, we're out of oil

your useless manifest, fable of a feeble god
your useless opinions don't amount to shit

your vicious lips revolt me
your view of religion
your virgin ass i can't resist it.
your vision of a brand new day
your vote for a pig, it wont be no loss
your vote is for those

your ways are too corrupt
your weak resistance is an indulgence i've become

you're the empire, the rebellion, but why?
you're too dumb to go on welfare
you're trapped in the thrill of speed, struggle for getting higher
you're tying up all the rules into a knot noose for me
