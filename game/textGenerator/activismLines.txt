but he had a hidden plan the people could not see.
but he had another plan
but he hears without fear what they state
but he hopes the maiden can be the last chance for the war
but he rules also those creatures
but he trusts in the rule of law and hates the current scapegoats.
but he was shot, the law was faster
but he will never be indicted for his crimes against this nation
but he wont say that in his dream state he crashes in the woods
but he'd sing for the masses if he just had the time
but he'll put you in the state penitentary, he'll put you in the federal
but he's got a plan to build a future he's been putting it off for way too long
but he's got a plan to get outta here
but he's stronger than a country hoss
but hearing you now filling your mouth with the cowards lies

but i have another plan.
but i have found it helps this state of disarray

but i know that tomorrow i will look upon the final remains of my empire,
but i know the rules
but i know who's gonna set me free
but i live by another set of rules and i know jsut what it takes to prove
but i lost my resistance
but i love this city, this state
but i make a lot of deliveries to government offices
but i move, like the president through town
but i must obey laws
but i need to feel free
but i need to know, i need to know how long you plan on dragging me through
but i never understood who even made the rules
but i offer all i am for the mercy of your plan
but i only see corruption
but i question you integrity
but i remember a revolution song
but i remember the revolution song
but i remember you when you loved freedom too
but i resist the exorcist
but i sat and opened in no certain order
but i saw a need on my big screen tv
but i saw so much of me in you, the me i've missed, the young and free in you
but i saw the victory
but i see victory, so all you have to do
but i shall surely win the war!
but i stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
but i stay on a mission, i'm on the grind
but i still love you, honey, please don't set me free
but i still wonder if pulling free is
but i tell you, justice ain't merely blind
but i think that's part of the plan
but i think your words were corrupted by love,
but i want to find an answer, so what if my terror dies
but i want to live free
but i wanted to start my life brand new
but i was a fool playing by the rules
but i was lost like a slave that no man could free
but i was smart and i quit school, started smoking, breaking rules
but i wasn't meant to burn out in some factory
but i will break...the laws of time
but i will destroy a system that's build on greed
but i will never be less than free
but i will never give up trying to free me from love
but i will never set you free
but i won't be corrupted
but i won't conform to your society
but i won't let them take what is left of my freedom
but i wont conform to this sillines,
but i worry 'bout what kids learn from tv
but i'd like to stay in and watch tv on my own, every now and then
but i'd rather be a free man in my grave
but i'd rather be a king of nothing than a servant in a sick society
but i'd rather write a song than a business plan
but i'll be damned if i'll ride rice, made in the usa.
but i'll break their rules
but i'll never be free from my sins of the past
but i'll set myself free with my pen-knife
but i'm a (badger?) and i get raw in the war
but i'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
but i'm a man with a mission tonight
but i'm a victim of society
but i'm actually the war starter
but i'm branded forever lame
but i'm breaking free, and you're helping me.
but i'm done with war.
but i'm feeling further from the end of war
but i'm feeling so free,
but i'm finally free of the past
but i'm free cuz i want you to be
but i'm free from the chain gang now
but i'm going to set it free
but i'm gonna go to war 'cause i made up my mind.
but i'm gonna set it free
but i'm just like you, flesh and blood, in need of revolution.
but i'm just speakin my truth, cause i heard it sets you free
but i'm not alone anymore. my vein rivers of pollution, injected harmony. i no
but i'm not free i feel more like a robot
but i'm not free of sin
but i'm not much company for long
but i'm not the only one with name brand shoes on,
but i'm on to your plan
but i'm running free otherwise, free as a bird
but i'm sick of you all, and i'm sick of opinions,
but i'm still in the bathtub so if you got cattle you best be fasting
but i'm still not free
but i'm struggling to find a balanced flow
but i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
but i'm to defy, i have to ignore her cry
but i'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk
but i'ma tell you this for free
but i's told him he could make it up by fixing the tv,
but i've been corrupted.
but i've come to see in the land of the free
but i've found some brand new arms,
but i've given up my rebellion
but i've got some news and this war is on
but i've got the company car
but i've taken up a brand new fight
but i, get it for free
but i, i get it for free
but i, i, i, i defend it
but if a war is what you want
but if all goes to my plan,
but if he aint got nuclear weapons he should keep on runnin'
but if he's mad at a country
but if i lived my life by my own rules
but if i vote against it
but if it's so good being free
but if not we had a plan for you we wont get far
but if the sun sets you free, sets you free
but if we don't stand against oppression we might as well embrace it
but if we're so fucking free
but if you don' t wish to be free
but if you insist well if you can't resist
but if you keep on teasin me girl, i'm gon' change your plan
but if you think you're free
but ignorance and arrogance rule the grounds
but ill order it from zanzibar
but im free yea im free
but im stuck here with me own company
but imagined his son a lawyer or broker,
but in a different way, in terror
but in a society so sick
but in a war all the snow is red
but in every war waged, only kings emerged unscathed
but in life you can't press rewind
but in my acts and deeds i'm a political man
but in my eyes you rule the world
but in my humble opinion
but in my opinion this is hardly enouth.
but in my opinion you can fuck the whales and save yourselves
but in my state of blind confusion
but in my state of mind i let him make his play
but in order that the world might be saved through him,
but in order to have my victory
but in order to have my victory-i gotta believe-ooh yeah!
but in order to live we still suffer on.
but in response our nation does nothing but lie
but in subvert city, it's subvert rule
but in the end corruption still exists
but in the end i can't defend you.
but in the end i know that i'll be free
but in the end is liberty guranteed?
but in the end the 7 families rule them all
but in the end they know that this war must be won
but in the end we know that this war must be won
but in the end we will realize the war for our souls
but in the end you will always be free to meet the ones above
but in the harsh reality, you're a media tool
but in the stars and closer to home, in every planet
but in the state of stagnation, only quality will prevail.
but in the war on war
but in this country, society itself is failing.
but in this night the red wine rules in me
but in this world exists the law
but inside in the dark i'm aching to be free
but is security after all a cause
but is this freedom just another hand from which we feed?
but it ain't for free, we gotta group that are our employees
but it ain't for revolution, it's just for cash
but it aint in my plan to make move without the fam
but it can't fight your resistance
but it don't always follow the rule no
but it feels like victory
but it fuels the economy, so i'm glad he had it
but it guards the ancient empire
but it is me, left here, to struggle through the night...
but it is not our nation state that needs to be saved
but it means don't hang yourself on a material life
but it only held enough oxygen
but it only increases your welfare check
but it seems to me a better plan than being used, and being screwed
but it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
but it shows lord cause nothing's free
but it was just an order of fries
but it was just the tv
but it was over when he had the plan
but it will be reality and you'll be free
but it won't be free
but it's "unpractical" to save the dying, they can't give food away for free
but it's - one nation indivisible
but it's a jungle when war is made,
but it's a war and we have no choice!
but it's a war they'll never win
but it's against the law to jump off this bridge
but it's all bollocks to me i'm like to smash my tv
but it's always the law
but it's attempts to rule the body is doomed to fail
but it's crying, claiming to be free
but it's gotta be pumpin' in order for me to get cream
but it's in his plan
but it's just the empire of a new master race
but it's my country too
but it's nice going down when it's free
but it's no use crying to you, you're who her plan has done the damage to
but it's not a war where we have no choice
but it's not me i'll never set you free
but it's not my fault, i'm just following your fucking stupid rules
but it's okay cause i'm still breathing and my hands are free of the heap
but it's only a minority in authority
but it's out of my hands, baby this is gods plan
but it's president (geeoorrggiiaa) bush
but it's sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
but it's the best soap on tv
but it's the jo that's country
but it's this one rule
but it's time to let it out so we can build a brand new castle.
but it's to make the world safe for democracy
but it's worth is decided by committee and has to obey the law and sharks
but its a brand new day
but its faceless company has let you down
but its like i mastered the art of war
but its not exactly what you would call free
but its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
but its the shit institution you love so much
but it's not a riot, though it's due in time
but i'll roach a spliff watching the tv
but i'll roach a spliff watching the tv for now
but jehovah god has set us free
but just remember when you think you're free
but justice is far from our hands
but keep hanging on i'm gonna read the riot act
but keep my movement swift because po's wanna frisk me up
but kept up high integrity
but kids too hard to have an opinion
but know this i'll win the fucking war!!!!
but know this, i'll win the fucking war!
but last night the plans of a future war
but lately i've been on a mission for commission
but laws were put upside-down and violence replaced the honor
but legally i was now in custody of the state
but let him go on to rule.
but let me defend myself
but let me know if i'm out of order
but let us be real, not pawns of ideal
but like a bird in a tree i got my liberty and i'm free from the chain gang now
but like all revolution before the throng of justice
but listen to the laws of nature
but living in a country where innocent human beings
but looking for freedom
but lord not any quicker than according to plan
but lord not any sicker than according to plan
but losing was not my plan
but love is not an option, our love is never free
but makes me order 3 orders of buffalo wings
but man cannot free itself from the authoritarian structures.
but man in his defiance, had made laws of his own
but manifest yourself
but mankind was the prism to the quintessence of corruption
but many of them will never come back from the raw, bloody war...
but mass acceptance dragged you down
but may they rule the night
but meanwhile the mayor runs free
but memories are free to borow
but mere subatomic particles of the nation
but midian will set me free
but mighty - that which don't obey any human law.
but modern day society has got to right these wrongs
but mommy call the cia someone blew up the usa
but more cause all you politicians do is fight
but more defy with weight of sins
but more important current political thought is
but more, more money for arms and war -
but morning light will free ya
but morning light will free you
but mother had sworn he went off to the war
but mr. gfk, state your business after that be one
but my doctrines will struggle
but my environment, makes it so impossible
but my ever growing family is spreading in mass
but my god can set you free if you would just let him in
but my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
but my heart says press on
but my insides will look like war
but my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
but my life is grit, all types of crisis and shit
but my misery loves the company
but my mission was erased
but my movement was too late as i slipped and hit the floor
but my plan was injured
but my power will defy you when my heart's on my sleeve
but my puppets can't know
but my sober state of mind won't let it happen
but my soul wants to break free from its prison shaped body
but my soul was still captive and not to be free
but my spirit was free
but my will is tied with puppet strings
but my will to ride free through the oceans of clouds
but naah i aint chuck b, its rule baby
but never again would he roam free
but never fight the downward spiral war
but never once is the order the same
but no chance for wasteland
but no christ to end this war
but no crime in a war
but no mass anymore to implore him
but no matter how much pain and protest, nothing seems to change
but no one can be free
but no one can rule the sun or sea no one owns the land or trees
but no one cares this war is won!
but no one comes around to free him at all
but no one is ever going to take my fucking rights back
but no one is going to take my fuckin rights back
but no plague, no war, no famine.
but no you not gonna see it on you tv

but not like you love your freedom
but not swimming free
but not today' i'm breaking free

but now he's just a picture on tv
but now his acts and thoughts are allowed to rule the world
but now i am free from their chains
but now i can and now i know i'm free

but now i will be free
but now i will set your free.
but now i'm a bitch that got a plan
but now i'm a rebel on a mission baby to live and die by my smile
but now i'm feeling happy i'm on that binny bin laden
but now i'm finally free!
but now i'm free again
but now i'm free and i can raise this child
but now i'm free in you

but now the holy dollar rules everybody's lives
but now the sheep are wailing
but now the war machines are mapping our destructions
but now there is mass unemployment
but now there's a target it's a fascist attack
but now this land, this land once pure and wide and free,

but now we want to change the rules
but now with mom dead? humongous is free to play!
but now you are free.
but now you feel like you're losing the war,
but now you have a plan.
but now you rule your destiny
but now you're free, forsaken me
but now your free at last
but now your mutilated corpse obeys the law of mortuary.
but now's our time for victory
but of course our president is clean.
but oil stains are all you're gonna find in my garage
but on the saturday night the chains of oppression fall down
but on the sly we never can`t be free
but on this planet we have done our job the worst
but on tv you can't tell
but once he tasted the power of killing he couldn't resist
but once the time would come he'll become free.
but once the war was done, blind fear prevailed
but one breath at a time is an acceptable plan
but one day she'll be free again
but one day the truth will set you free
but one day watch i'll be pimp of the nation
but one of the warriors flouted the rules
but one thing they can't teach you is how to feel free
but only alone can we both be free
but only fools follow rules
but only free will has it's sustain
but only in order to make a word comprehensible
but only people oppress
but open the eye, actually the third war is already happening
but oppression breeds obsession like another mean season
but oppression breeds resistance and resistance is what we need
but order in chaos we never provide
but our gods shall rule the sky
but our planet still dies. . .
but our population grew
but our strength sets us free
but outside in the streets, those demons are the law
but paled in society,
but people never seem to listen, the're all brainwashed by the system
but people's freedom
but plan ahead for mountains you have yet to climb
but plan it well, everything's at stake
but please only within the confines of the social system
but political animosity prevailed upon the stage
but political incompatibility led to their downfall
but politics are so much better when there's sex
but politics has barred the door
but politics makes us think too hard!
but praise god he's got a plan and understanding isn't my place
but pride can come to rule the ones
but principle can conquer law
but principle can conquer the law
but putting up with it is still the rule
but rather than struggling or putting up a fight
but real muslims believe in paradise and the resist the shaitan
but really was a nerd at penn state
but revolution will turn the world grey
but right then i remember why i'm here, why i'm free.
but sally all empires fall
but see i've got my freedom now and we are over
but see me i wanna fuck for free like akinyele
but seeing you has got me on a mission
but seems like politicians can be only wrong!
but she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
but she could rule the world when she opens up her mouth and smiles
but she had a plan inside day of revenge is near
but she just turns in wonder - "what is war?" is all she says
but she's shaking like a revolution
but shorty had a plan for them both
but should you ever piss oil,
but shouting is free!
but since i'm the president, i'll be a lil more politic
but since ya'll watches look like its movement
but sleep won't set me free
but snitchin breaks the code, gotta lie in your made bed (you know the rules)
but so is cod liver oil
but social guilt the barrier to giving what is gained
but society is only a mass of people
but society is your wife
but society slams me
but society sucks you out, leads to early decay.
but solemnly sworn to return with holy war
but some day you'll free em oh yeah
but some people struggle, inner demons are too much
but some plan for the kingdom of heaven
but some seem more free than me
but some things in life you must resist
but someday i'll be free
but someday we'll be free
but someday you'll be free
but somehow still we struggle along
but somehow the freedom is gone
but someone's got to teach the world about texas-sized justice
but something happened with me, i'm not dead i want be free
but sometimes i can't resist
but sometimes it's best to just set yourself free
but sometimes when i'm alone like this i wonder how much it's just institution
but soon enough their mission done
but stagnant minds persist to squeeze blood from this stone
but stand up and fight for freedom
but stealthily, in the land of the free,
but still a puppet in the play
but still at night when darkness rules again
but still don't understand the system
but still i cant resist!
but still i fight and struggle within
but still i hold heat ready to ride to war
but still i press on'
but still i'd look better than a puppet tryin to get paid
but still i'm on a mission, yo i'm not buggin'
but still on the road doin free shows
but still she's trying; she's always trying to find sight of utopia;
but still so beautiful wastelands of grief
but still so beautiful wastelands of solitude
but still sometimes i feel like a walkin conspiracy theory
but still struggling
but still the brilliant tale of our utopia survives
but still the country in a terrible state
but still the empire falls
but still the pride goes on blindly and in so-called freedom they gloat
but still there is war, and their helter helter
but still there's a mass of people
but still they say you must go free
but still we keep on struggling
but still you don't feel free.
but still you try to free yourself
but still you wanna sing your protest song
but still you want to sell the revolution
but stranger set me free
but struggle builds character
but struggle to a finish
but such useless forms of protest would never prevent a war
but surrounded by society
but surviving in the system still feels like i'm being caged
but systems can be changed by our hands.
but systems will berak down
but systems will break down
but take it from me i know everybody love to be free
but tear them up when we smell oil
but tha bravest of all men obey gods rules...
but thank god the tv is on
but thanks to her, the most perfect creature was free
but that doesn't press by what you do
but that goes to show you how fast the laws work
but that is freedom something they would not understand
but that is not her plan
but that isn't for free
but that will never happen in our society
but that won't change the nation
but that won't happen to me, because i'm sugar free
but that's okay, 'cause that's not the mission
but that's one state i'm never in

but you have stopped his plan
but you have to resist the pain that i give
but you haven't won the war
but you in god's loving plan might be the missing part.
but you just had to break free
but you just won't say you built this conformist system
but you keep on struggling.

but you know there's victory in the lord, i say.
but you know what the say, the free market closes at the end of the day
but you know you won't be free

but you won't listen - you watch the planet burn
but you won't listen - you watch the planet turn
but you would set free in daylight
but you write it off as an industry scam
but you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
but you'll always find those who oppose!!
but you'll never be free
but you'll never be free without a fight
but you're always on a mission,
but you're feeling high and free
but you're just a puppet of an orbital idiocy
but you're not gonna be the one who lays down my laws
but you're on my five-year plan
but you're signing up for war
but you're still hesitant to fight for your rights.
but you're still in this society
but you're too young to vote

but you've got something i can't resist somehow
but you've taught me to be a pawn
but your a terrorist of bigotry
but your algebra your politics

but your fucked up fucking laws don't mean a thing to me
but your hands are still free from the tide
but your law dressed in
but your life could be more if you don't always conform
but your love has set me free
but your message, revolution, just don't fit with my constitution
but your mission end on the cross
but your mission you must hide
but your oil paintings are destroyed by fire
but your one time chance is never free...
but your opinions have no ground
but your opinions keep on coming
but your plan backfired
but your plan didn't work, it didn't come close
but your rebellion is just a product, 15 minutes until downfall
but your rev better be louder then my system that is bumpin'
but your secrets free
but your stupid fucking media let loose a river full of shit
but your war is not with me
but your war is still around

doc wie schon so oft war der steinge' weg das ziel
doch alles in allem war es wirklich ziemlich zahm,
doch als du fortgingst war ich nicht bei dir,
doch als punker war ich schwer schockiert
doch auch f'r ihn war es bald vorbei,
doch auch mit liliane war es schlie''lich vorbei
doch dann war dunkelheit
doch das demokratische system
doch das m&auml;dchen war vernarrt,
doch das war dir schon immer gleich
doch das, was mit der muttermilch in meine seele gelangt war,
doch der erste schritt das war die gr''te m'h'
doch der met in den f'ssern war golden
doch der ruf der nacht war s''er als die stimmen der tiefe
doch der schmerz war nur kurz, zu kalt war der geifernde eiszahn.
doch der war noch von letztem jahr
doch der weg war umsonst, die pforten versclossen
doch der weg war wohl zu weit.
doch diese frau, sie war ein schwein und stahl ihm eines nachts sein geld,
doch eines, das war mir unscheinbar:
doch endlich sengst sich schw'rze auf das, was ich einst war.
doch es war l'ngst zu sp't
doch es war oft schon so, ich hab das nicht so gern
doch es war stumpf und grau verhangen
doch es wird die zeit kommen da all unsere tr'ume war werden
doch f'r dich war das nur ein scherz
doch ich werde sie besiegen, ich habe einen plan
doch ihr habt eure seele dem system verkauft
doch kein knast war je schlimmer
doch nichts ist mehr so, wie es einstmals war
doch nun war es das letzte mal, nochmal kriegt man dich nicht
doch war die last f'r ihn zu schwer
doch war es nicht das meine
doch war ich nicht mensch,
doch was er fand, war das meer, der einsamkeit geifernde
doch was war da? da hat sich wieder was geregt!
doch wei' ich immer noch nicht, wer der erste war
doch... der tod war nicht das ende.

hip hop comes before the war
hip hop nation, vibe affiliation
hip-hop is in a state as if it was a baby bein murdered
hip-hop is not a nation, take it to population
hip-hop past all your tall social hurdles
hippies suck that's what i think politicians
hire men to change the law, protect and serve with one small flaw
his 7 legions, play with war, his command
his ability was manipulation of telekinetic properties
his almightyness i defy
his ancient mind got old in eternity, now it craves for brand new brain
his bible was the law of the sword
his body is a country
his brain at war haunting his spirit
his brain is in war and the evil will rise
his breath came in spurts from an oxygen tank.
his brilliance betrayed by the ones he wants to free
his brow torn by the horns of victory
his career was a big success rolling stone cover in a state of undress
his child with the blood of the black mass!
his children lost to free will
his chin on his club, sheep all around him, in barsa cohanului.
his company is doing well, but it's tearing him apart
his corporate image forced upon
his cousin rules his land
his cowardly men run away, victory is ours this day
his daddy was a "peace keeper" in iraq
his dark plan. but they were turned into stone by
his daughter panting, crouched in terror
his eager taste for victory
his education was coming to an end
his empire is martiry and pain
his empire shall be forever gone
his empire, black market wealth
his epic fall... in this evil war...
his evil lives on terror reigns again.fear of violent death fills the hearts
his face is a mass of entrails of animals and men
his face is cracked from the wicked hands of time, and scars from war have
his face red like a rose on a thorn bush
his father made him go give back to his country.
his father torn in tides of war
his feeling of injustice dies
his final mission, with nothing to fear
his fingers flick the tarot deck keep weak ones mesmerized
his fingers stiff with anticipation, as he plots his next feeble plan
his fire's not real, i now inside that i already hold victory
his first fight in the war
his first riot and pain
his flock had gone astray wolves mingling with sheep
his flock of sheep is led astray
his former classmates got spread out over society
his freedom is perfect
his freedom only comes in a envelope
his freedom only comes in a fucking envelope
his freedom only comes in an envelope
his freedoms, rights, and privacy neglected
his friends that were killed for the reason of war that is fought over lies,

i struggle convulsively.
i struggle day by day; how much can one man take?
i struggle everyday just to make it through
i struggle for letters to piece into words
i struggle for my life
i struggle for the words and then give up
i struggle in pain coming out of focus
i struggle in pain i like violence in you
i struggle in vain at last, i've managed to board
i struggle in violated space,
i struggle just to hold back the tears
i struggle now and i know why,
i struggle on beneath these clouds
i struggle on with no thought for myself
i struggle on, seems so useless
i struggle on.. i've journeyed for so long.. for glory..
i struggle so much, but my hate remains unseen
i struggle sometimes to find the words
i struggle though trials
i struggle through the day
i struggle to breathe
i struggle to cope with what's happening
i struggle to decide
i struggle to find the words
i struggle to hold on

i suceeded getting my collage education completed
i sucked the state for what it was worth
i suggest you break free or
i summon thy masses to obey

i think in ancient china they kinda
i think it began back in 1992 - flames and riots and my innocence was through
i think it is sad the opinion you had
i think it sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
i think it was against the law
i think it's a law of life
i think it's time for some media posturing
i think it's time to use this company i keep
i think it's time we find a new way to pick a president.
i think it-s time for you to understand: this is war
i think i'll blaze all day and marvel at the mass of food i eat
i think i'll make a note to change my plan
i think they better call bush 'cause it's a national disaster
i think they're selling snake oil,
i think this is the right decision, now we start our final mission...
i think this is the worst state that the kitchen's ever been
i think you are on a mission to abuse me i exploit
i think you low on oxygen
i think you watch too much tv

i've heard of liberation and deliverance
i've heard the freedom cries from high upon the throne
i've heard the hype about your band, ive seen your video playing on the tv
i've just learned to set mine free.
i've just set out on a brand new race,
i've kept some company i shouldn't have (well alright)
i've killed all their leaders, their laws, and their ways
i've killed in order to survive
i've learned that victory
i've learned to hide my mental state
i've led the victory.
i've left all the crisis behind me
i've lived my life by my own rules
i've lost all resistance
i've lost another war
i've lost my country, i've lost my throne
i've lost my house and home through the system
i've lost the reflex to resist
i've lost this battle but i'm still in the war
i've loved the freedom of being inside
i've made the rules of this new game
i've never been free
i've never felt so loved, so peaceful and so free
i've never felt this free before
i've never lived the master plan
i've never seen you when you weren't on tv
i've opened up your word to free me
i've passed all night to see, rocco's films on tv
i've passed away now, into peaceful war
i've passed the entry of the system
i've played this in my mind.... feeling free, feeling free.
i've prayed to god to set me free
i've prayed until i have free will i've shut out all the lies
i've put myself in a state i can't portray
i've re-defined the laws of friends
i've rejected the rules of hands and heart
i've resigned myself without resistance to my fate
i've returned to make justice
i've roamed the spaces wild and free
i've sacrificed my blood for free
i've screamed religious scam
i've searched for the land where i could be free
i've seen a million in a nation in a feud
i've seen a million places branded by the lord of flies
i've seen all the falling buildings on the tv hotel bed.
i've seen empires rise and blown away
i've seen extremes from love to war
i've seen four year old children conforming to media roles
i've seen it all, every goddamn state
i've seen my comrades falling killed by the winter desert's law
i've seen my generation broken off forevermore
i've seen the daylight break and freedom never felt so free
i've seen the headlines in the papers,
i've seen the likes of kate bush
i've seen the powers of faith, holy terror unseen
i've seen the terror and watched the dead molest my loved ones gone
i've seen this all before, i can't carry this anymore, break free
i've seen war today,
i've seen you on the beach and i've seen you on tv
i've seen you playing my own rules
i've seen your closet, decadence resides there
i've seen your free declared intention, but not today
i've set free my head, they labeled me just mad
i've set the demons free
i've snatched a victory from defeat
i've sought not freedom nor espy
i've spent too many years at war with myself
i've spread them nation wide
i've ssen the preachers on the tv
i've stepped beyond the law divine and gone beyond limits set, prescribed
i've taken all your rights
i've taken the bait and now my mind has been set free
i've taken the terror
i've taken what was free and saved it all for me
i've talked to press, tv and radio
i've the chance to rule the land
i've the mission for you
i've traveled every country, i've traveled in my mind
i've traveled these war lands deep
i've traveled through the complete metamorphosis of the justice system,
i've tried my best to hear out the masses,
i've tried so hard to reel you closer to freedom
i've watched him struggle and i've watched him age
i've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
i've wised up, but these leather shoes were free
i've worked for all and had nothing for free.
i've yelled social security
i, corrupted and old, future foretold
i, deliverer of god. organizer of solar systems.
i, faethon, rule the sky
i, i collide with love as an elusive state of mind
i, i get it for free
i, i got my kenwood system fixed, that bass sure kicks
i, i see the terror in it's eye
i, i take it for free
i, i want somebody who can set me free
i, i, i, i get it for free
i, the sovereign authority
i, well i get it for free
i-i don't need your company
i-you go find yourself a factory man
i...i'm the master of this war plan and i rule this land with my iron hand.
i.q. zero, stupid heroes rule the world
i;m not in prision,but i'm never free
i?ll keep on killing in the name of liberty,
i?m seeing all the lies of our leaders - every war that they feed us
i_ve been reborn in a world of consumption
i`ll break free of the miracle
i`ll take the strength i have inside and my psychic guide to set me free
i`m a punk and this is anarchy
i`m born to kill, born to be free
i`m fighting for freedom
i`m fine since we are free
i`m here to let you know that we are free, yeah
i`m here to tell you all that we are free

i`m standing on my feet again, i`m standing free
i`m the chosen one to lead this people through this war
i`m there prisoner of war, prisoner of life,
i`ve finally broke free
i`ve fled this promised freedom
i`ve walked among the dead but now i`m free again

ich - ich war schon einmal hier
ich aber h'rte auf mein herz, alles andre war egal.
ich bin nicht bei dir, noch nie war ich dir so nah
ich bin und war und wird nie wieder gl'cklick sein.
ich bin was war, was kommen mag
ich dacht ich w'r unsterblich, das war nur ein traum
ich hab dich fallen sehn - nichts ist so wie es mal war
ich hab heut 'n anderen plan,
ich hab' versucht was zu erzwingen, doch die zeit war noch nicht reif
ich habe blond gef'rbtes haar, weil's in den 80-ern mode war
ich hatte zeit und mir war kalt drum trat ich ein
ich kann nicht sagen, wie viel zeit vergangen war
ich komm grad aus amerika, war nicht so erfolgreich da,
ich mann der komik war versunken,
ich merk' wie sch'n der sommer war
ich nannte es leben, weil ich euch die geisel war,
ich nehme objekte und deren umgebung war
ich sah dich an und fragte mich, weshalb es nicht wie fr'her war
ich schreib von saufen + gewalt, sex und anarchy
ich schrie solang ich konnte, bis keine luft mehr war.
ich sehe keine farben mehr, nur tod und das, was fr'her war
ich stehe nackt und hilflos vor dem morgen nie war ich so stark
ich verfluchte einen jeden, war mir stets zuerst im wege
ich war an einem ort, an dem nur das vergessen z'hlt
ich war auf der gallerie meines geistes
ich war das dunkle aller welten
ich war deinem scho' hoffnungslos ergeben...
ich war der krieg, der jedes land in atem hielt
ich war der trupp der maden,
ich war der weg, ich bin das ziel -
ich war die bombe, die auf hiroshima fiel
ich war die pest, der tausende zum opfer fiel
ich war die seuche, die den k&ouml;rper
ich war dir hilflos ausgeliefert
ich war doch nur bengel, der dich nicht verstand...
ich war dort als das leben begann
ich war dort und habe alles gesehen.
ich war ein leben lang der loser
ich war ein netter kleiner junge
ich war einfach viel zu schlau
ich war entt'uscht und fing zu weinen an
ich war f'nf, als mein vater starb, da wurde meine welt zur h'lle.
ich war ganz nah - dem kalten fleisch
ich war ganz schwer am suchen
ich war gar ungezogen heute
ich war gerade bei der bundeswehr
ich war gern homosexuell
ich war hilflos wie ein blatt im wind
ich war h'sslich wie die nacht
ich war in der w'ste, bin ziellos rumgeirrt
ich war in dir - zu seh'n; und umgekehrt
ich war in terra nola ...
ich war in terra nola, wo die tr'nen versteinern
ich war mein leben lang der loser
ich war nie gut in deutsch und mathematik
ich war nie mehr einsam,
ich war noch nicht da, als das alles begann
ich war noch nie so nah bei dir
ich war noch oft - bei ihren gr&auml;bern
ich war nur einsam ohne den freund
ich war schon fr&uuml;her nicht wichtig ich war mal schizuphren
ich war so untr'stlich,
ich war und werde immer sein
ich war viel lieber terrorist
ich war von mut erf'llt konnte berge versetzen
ich war von trauer erf'llt,
ich war zu voll und habe leider deinen namen vergessen
ich war zwei wochen arbeiten
ich war z'rtlicher zu dir als je zuvor!
ich wei' sie war doch einmal hier
ich wei' sie war doch einmal hier - in mir
ich wei', wer ich war
ich wusste erst nicht, wer er war
ich, ich war dabei - ich, ich war dabei
ick war schon immer son warzenschwein

it all leads to me, independent and free
it all seems very easy, this revolution game
it bears forever everlasting peoples' freedom
it bears to all exploitation
it becomes a possession to - defy the oppression
it began with chemo war, death rays and fire guns even killed the night.
it branded the concept of living and lying
it breaks the system
it breaks us down with every war
it breathes the pollution and pisses gray
it brings upon us more of famine death and war
it brings you to a state of natral high
it broke free, from the reins of its origin
it brought surrender to this internal war.
it burdens me i'm never free
it burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees
it burns, class war, now its our turn,
it called them on into terror to a house alone without name,
it calls it's name to the masses!
it can be feel the mass loss of humanity
it can be used on a society of the most ignorant to the most highly educated
it can erase the planet and there's
it can start a new war or finish old fights
it can't be about material gain
it can't deserve to rule
it cannot be their plan
it comes again... the state i love and hate
it comes forth from heavy industry
it comes from the whole nation
it comes through the heavens, on a mission from hell
it comes to execute it's rules
it costs less to buy it brand new
it could be me on the tv in you living room
it could be the thing that sets you free
it could have been bit off in a struggle
it could only happen in america , god bless the usa
it could save us all from the war
it could set your life free, yeah
it creeps through the veil of democracy
it cries as war does consume the skies
it cries out in anger for more bloodshed, that is the law!
it crushes forth (resenting) conquest its plan
it determines the rules
it devastates, laying waste to pathetic corporate norms
it didn't matter that i was living for free there
it doesn't feel like freedom
it doesn't fit the plan!
it doesn't give you free integrity
it doesn't matter if victory is possible
it doesn't matter what state i'm in
it doesn't take a rebel to sing along.
it doesnt matter cause it's free to waste your life
it doesn't matter just be sure that this is our empire this is war
it don't matter whats your name and your opinion
it dont cost nothing its free(freebie)(lets get it on)
it drains the faith that lights the dark and sets us free
it echoes hard to pinch a part of freedom -
it ended in the 2nd global war
it extends an eerie invitation (spook city usa)
it feeds her war and raises my true nature. when i awake i am whole.
it feels good to see freedom embraced
it feels good to see freedom excepted
it feels like my loneliness is a victory
it feels like there's no freedom
it feels like, no freedom, but life to go.
it feels so good watching the wasteland grow
it felt good to be the rebel for the day
it felt so good to be all free
it flies free above all this
it flows through my heart, i must set it free
it fuckin sets me free, and let me breathe
it fuels the war into
it gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
it gave me my brand new home
it gave me time to contemplate, the state of my hair and it's terrible fate
it gave you a mission
it gets invented and produced in mass the very next day
it gives me strength and i brake free...
it goes and die. masters and slaves, pawns in a game,
it goes far beyond and unfortunately i learn that in this war i am just a pawn
it goes lick, swallow, suck, and order another
it goes to show you can't resist the fatal blow
it got sold to our generation
it had to be from the heart in order to be reality
it happens so fast not a part of my plan
it has always been my best company.
it has been optimized to run on any system
it has been so long since i have been truly free
it has fallen by the nuclear knife
it has its own justice and my dreams are languid and lawless. and everything
it has the power, makes the planet turn
it has to be based upon one's own rules and values.
it has to be objective in order to be discussible.
it has to do with freedom and personal liberty
it helps you to rule out the sorrow
it holds the truth to set you free
it hovered above, i saw my order
it hurts when they press and they won't let you rest
it in turn will set you free
it in your hand. what's the plan? what's the plan? is it a dream? is
it inpires men to stand up for their rights
it is a brand new day.
it is a circle, there is a plan
it is a citizen's duty to resist the system that pits us against one another
it is a law that depends only on mutation and evolves itself rapidly
it is a struggle for existence
it is a tragedy, of this "democracy"
it is a war over years and years
it is all a conspiracy
it is an exposition of opinions and it's the blind leading the blind
it is at the magnitude of daily murders, massacres and mass graves
it is bound to set you free
it is clearly a non human authority.
it is fantasy freedom; tied to galleys we row
it is faster than your tv
it is for our generation
it is free, so you'll be
it is futile to resist
it is here (i will defend you)
it is how your people crushed the country thoughtlessly down
it is just a different state of mind
it is just a filthy war
it is justice not respect i'm after
it is money that rules the world,
it is more than just a phrase, fighting for my rights
it is my passion to be free
it is my sheep they follow
it is only area to which the council can communicate with this planet.
it is probably that an all out nuclear war
it is real as anything the system has made
it is said that terror lives behind the wall of privacy
it is set free more and more
it is sincerely what rules our fears
it is sweet and meet fitting to die for ones country.
it is the art of could balance the movement
it is the coward's way that lets this terror go
it is the dawn in which the underdog finds the strength to rebel
it is the holy terror
it is the joy of contributing to the planet
it is the land of the free
it is the time to declare the war
it is the time to defend our motherland!
it is the triumph of the blasphemous masses
it is the voice called conspiracy
it is the voice of government speaking to ignorance
it is the war to end all wars
it is thy heritage to rule the world
it is time for a love revolution
it is time for the war
it is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
it is time to conform
it is time to finally set you free
it is time to rearrange, time for a protest movement
it is time! we shall rule, and upon our dominion the sun shall never set!
it is time, it is time, for a love revolution
it is to maintain that overall system
it is to see a traitor go free
it is to set a soul free
it is too late you can't be set free
it is trolls going to war
it is victory, or death
it is what one calls war
it is your corrupt we claim. it is your evil that will
it isn't a conspiracy it's common sense, the upper tier lives at our expense
it isn't free. i see that you don't believe, ooo-oo, but you will see.
it isn't hard to get an education
it isn't much, but i'm free at last
it just don't ever stop, so industry, prepare for me
it just might set you free and not me...
it just might set you free, not me ...
it just started like got you up in my system
it justifies, nas escobar's leavin shit mesmerized
it keeps her company
it keeps me from falling into another state of mind
it keeps us locked in our submissive state
it keeps us oppressed
it kills to be dishonest but you're not an exception to the rule
it kisses moroth in his freedom flight
it know it's gonna get you, but you're too blind to let yourself be free
it leads us to order
it left a hole in me as black as night, just a pawn in their charade
it left me pimple free
it levels and crushes at its free will
it licks its jowls and, threatens to gnaw free
it lives for death and brutal war to all that find its world,
it locks so nice on the tv screen
it looked so good, your perfect plan
it looks a lot like engine oil and tastes like being poor and small
it looks into a world of terror
it looks like a revolution but it's only the truth
it looks like an invisible planet
it looks like the system
it looks like you need some company
it looms and towers over me like the statue of liberty
it loved this terror and sent bloodhounds into the country
it made all the rights wrong
it made me brand new again
it make you feel so free, you no turn it down
it makes me feel uncomfortable like there's a lack of equality
it makes me realize: i'm free...
it makes me sick, the thought of it - your filthy exploitation
it makes no sense for us to be pawns
it makes up its own rules
it makes up your opinion more than once
it manifest in chaos -destroying all in it's path -this pulverizing
it may surprise the majority
it means a new war, but they don't know
it might cause a riot
it might change the plan
it might strike up a riot
it might use during an armed revolt.
it moves across me and sets me free
it must be a cool state of mind
it must be a riot if they're calling for backup
it must be law exploding all the balls
it must be now, we must revolt
it must be part of my plan
it must be the influence of society
it must be the rebel in me
it must be tough when society is messed up
it must remain a secret, or the plan will never work
it never ceases this struggle, this pain
it never was my plan to be a one woman man
it never was the plan
it never was too easy to rule
it never works but we keep tryin' like fools learning and breaking the rules
it now engulfs you, the terror it builds too the fear
it only gives you power and power makes the rules.
it only has first class, free your mind brother
it only reminds me i'm not free
it only takes one break of a pose to get oil
it oppressed the masses... minds are admires...
it oughta be against the law.
it overcomes in justice
it pays to brake the law
it probably don't seem like a struggle
it rejoins the final blaze disorder
it reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system
it representin the struggle man.
it rights the imbalance of fire
it rules in the hearts of millions
it rules it's reign, i pray for the end of time,
it rules me, drags me into black
it rules my mind, your spirit haunts me time and time again.
it rules them ,you will see
it rules your judgement on what is false or true
it runs right though our society
it runs through my blood, i'm free
it s fiery meaning shall make thee free
it sang like freedom calls
it saturates the system
it screams out for freedom
it seemed to be life was free
it seems absurd he's off scott free
it seems everybody has a social sect
it seems i'm never breaking free
it seems like everyone's on victory
it seems like freedom
it seems like he got the whole country behind him
it seems like terror is winning the battle
it seems my brand new candles would catch on fire today
it seems nothing good is free
it seems she needs to oil her spine
it seems so absurd that we are denied the chance of ever being truly free
it seems so futile, forgiveness, your freedom
it seems that they just wanted to make an alternative society
it seems that we were always free
it seems that your mission is to blind-fold the crowd
it seems the house can't set me free
it seems the war didn't go quite as planned
it seems to me simple, just strive for mental freedom,
it seems to me simple, just strive for mental freedom, don't end up =
it seems to me the time is right, for another generation
it seems to me you want to rule all over me
it seems to me your test was my plan
it seems we're all at war
it seems you plan to stay
it set my fury free t
it sets me free to hear you scream
it sets me free, destroying my disguise.
it sets my spirits free
it shall reap the survivors
it shares to you and you cannot resist
it shocked her system from within  so she lies staring at the images inside
it shook me and questioned my integrity
it should be a law against me and you
it shouldn't hurt me to be free
it slayed him self in devotion and resistance
it slays in violent horror, it preys in war ...
it snowballs into worthless pawns, multiplying, buying
it so fresh out da press, grey goose on the rocks..
it spills across the factory floor.
it spreads disease where freedom rings
it spreads its revolution wide from cell to cell to cell
it started after the war when israel got their land
it started many years ago, out of the black country
it starts up in our bedroom after the war
it struggles to be free
it suits the laws written
it takes a bit of piss to put the spice in victory
it takes a laugh or two go with your heart and free your mind
it takes a nation of millions to hold me back
it takes a slanted state of mind
it takes away your freedom
it takes manifest in this,
it takes more than a shout for a tyrant to get down
it takes more than ooo material things
it takes one man, to start a war
it takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker
it takes war to finally see
it takes your freedom from you
it time for generation
it took no time to blend in, with the population prison
it took the agenda from its place in my bed
it took the truth to set me free, to set me free
it took three damn days for the mission man
it tore me up to sign them papers that set you free
it tries to break me tries to set me free
it tries-but i'm free!
it used to be free but now it's bound
it used to be the plan was: screwing the man
it verifies assurance that we won another war
it violates old laws, repeals all orders
it vomits sticky oil on me
it wants a war when ya get drafted
it wants to break free
it was a conspiracy!
it was a damn good plan
it was a different place, a different state
it was a game, now it's a war
it was a hit and run jus on the free way
it was a masonic conspiracy
it was a new generation, aiming for eternety
it was a plan ronnie had scammed
it was a private institution in the name of punk-rock
it was a simple plan, but not what you expected
it was a summer night by the mass ave bridge
it was a time for me to announce my victory
it was a tribute to a fallen brother and from across the nation
it was according to plan,
it was against the law
it was all combed out with the system up
it was all different people livin on the planet
it was all in the great state parks
it was all just one big part of your master plan
it was all the master plan, of one legendary punk rock kid
it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
it was as if the entire population had suddenly gone underground
it was black freedom day, a prayer and a hope
it was clear why the struggle was so painful
it was clearly a mission for the comfort of the road
it was developed in the art of war
it was for our rights our ancestors died
it was hard for me,to see your plan for me
it was just me and the hoes was free
it was last week we were watching tv
it was made by my order
it was my belief that even the minorities, had a valid voice in our society
it was my final chance - got glory and victory
it was no place for justice
it was not a glorious victory for the british spirit,
it was sealed by a mechanical movement
it was simple propaganda to connect with the new humans
it was sold to the sly nation
it was something wrong and then i marched towards the authority
it was struggling with darkness
it was that institution as your last solution
it was the beginning of my empire
it was the company you kept, the many places you slept
it was the greatest funeral, i laid in perfect state
it was the mighty empire fallen from grace
it was the old rock and roll under brand new control
it was the struggle of the century,
it was the summer of the riots
it was the time we cried for justice loud
it was the worst of this war
it was them - who made the rules
it was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
it was time for victory
it was time to draw the swords, to begin a new war.
it was to bring a total mass hysteria
it was war on the terraces
it was war through lies on demand
it was you - that set the spirit free
it was you - that set the spirit free denim and leather
it was you that set the spirit free
it was you that set the spirit free (repeat to end)
it was you that set the spirit free it was you - that set the spirit free
it was you who set me free...
it was you, bringing your white company
it wasn't easy but now i'm free
it wasn't even in my plan
it wasn't me that started that old crazy asian war,
it weathers the storm and the grimness of war, it's the one
it went on for, what seemed like hours of terror
it will be mine to corrupt
it will be revolution
it will go on forever, your power i defy
it will make the silver chords, the state of all
it will never measure up to what tv sells as great
it will not desist until i manifest
it will press me off again to the daylight
it will seal the fate of man - envisage the terror
it will set me free, my time has come
it will set you free
it will start up a riot 'n'
it will take a war that we will probably lose
it will take some time but victory is
it will yet come to war.
it winks and haunts the sad i'm free
it won't be a victory,
it won't be an uphill struggle
it won't be reversed as the plan is the blueprint
it won't need much to free
it works within the system and they won't understand
it would be blatantly naive to expect a new society overnight,
it would be blatantly naive to expect a new society overnight, but =
it would be cool just to be in your company
it would be easier to run, but to face them makes me free.
it would be folly to defy the eldest law
it would be his throne room where he'd rule
it would be my chance to be free.
it would beat the war to the top of the news
it would go up against every rule
it'a a war of the heart
it'a a war of the heart (it's a war of the heart)
it'd do a little good to let the world be free
it'll be standard procedure across the nation
it'll free me from my future
it'll free your soul
it'll get ya house payments on a thirty year plan
it's "paranoid" - first degree, it's telling me that i'm not free
it's '87 state of mind that i'm in (mind that i'm in)
it's 'eyes front' in a nation of disinformation.
it's 'our newest plan ever!'
it's 1969 ok all across the usa
it's 1984 and there's gonna be a war
it's 7am on a brand new day
it's a bar room filled with branded rejections,
it's a beautiful day maybe we'll get our state park on
it's a beautiful feeling, a social kind of thing
it's a big conspiracy, they hate youth and they hate me
it's a billion dollar industry
it's a bit much to blaze up, rule and chuck, n-i-g, the murderous, i-n-c
it's a black sheep day, but i wont be stashed away
it's a boring planet, thanks to us and no one else
it's a boring planet, we're just lying to ourselves
it's a brand new age
it's a brand new day
it's a brand new day, i drove hard all night

it's a brand new feel
it's a brand new game and how our lives will pass
it's a brand new game and not quite what i thought

it's a brand new me, piece by piece
it's a brand new sunset
it's a brand new world
it's a brand new world's deep sound
it's a city of destruction, and it's called freedom.
it's a cold - bloody war
it's a cold mission, they pull up beside you,
it's a conspiracy to make you believe in everything you can see
it's a constant struggle
it's a corporate threat to freedom
it's a corrupted world
it's a country of my ancestors'
it's a crucial conspiracy
it's a cry for no government, a cry to be free
it's a cultural thing from all country wide
it's a dance, tired steps in brand new shoes
it's a democracy, not aristocracy
it's a desperate search for a master plan
it's a disappointment to see niggas flip on rule like they double jointed
it's a drive down a dead end street on the path of most resistance
it's a face i've seen before. in a distant mental war
it's a face of a war machine.
it's a fascist regime south africa
it's a fight to the top of the system son,
it's a first time for everything, settin you free
it's a fool who is living by the rules that are given by
it's a form of rebellion; it comes from the street
it's a fraud, your view of equality
it's a free gift he's offering you, please take it and become his child
it's a free land of opportunity
it's a free trip down to london for a weekend of high life.
it's a free wind from the past
it's a free, free world and i'm taken it
it's a free, free world and i'm taken it what
it's a freedom of choice now honey
it's a fucked up world in a boring state of mind
it's a fucking discrace how the sane and unable rule the world
it's a game with simple rules
it's a gangsta nation
it's a generation overload
it's a generation, generation, genocide
it's a global inferno of toxic wastelands
it's a global village in a high-tech age
it's a huge influence you got upon on the industry
it's a hustle called capitalism
it's a killing system
it's a lack of respect and authority
it's a lame conspiracy
it's a landscape of terror of evil's dark hue
it's a law for all that's born
it's a lifestyle revolution
it's a lightning war
it's a little war - i get used to this fight
it's a long hard revolution, oh good god i feel like a liberal
it's a long way to our freedom
it's a march for freedom
it's a material world
it's a matter of integrity
it's a matter of mind you know you can be free forever
it's a messed up, fucked up fuckin' system
it's a midlife crisis...
it's a million mc's upon a plan they call real tryin' to set it
it's a mission accomplished

it's been illusive for so long but freedom is mine today
it's been suggested that you're out to finish up your daddy's war
it's been up and down the country roads
it's being on that road that makes me free
it's better safe than sorry, watch your back this is a war
it's better that you make a stand, war is near
it's better to live on the run set me free, set me free
it's better to struggle than to take the easy way out

it's ill as a war and within it i'm the lieutenant
it's immoral to encourage others to accept injustice you do not endure,
it's impossible given the incident, given his catatonic state
it's in man's nature to react according to and against these structures.
it's in me and i can't resist it
it's in my hands to rule and command
it's in the brand of your clothes
it's in the lesson plan for school, tell the teacher he's a fool
it's in the mirror that the real war starts

it's never glad about injustice
it's no struggle to confront now 'cause what's said is said
it's no use, this war is all i see
it's no way to be free
it's not "music" but propaganda
it's not a blueprint or a master plan
it's not a cause or political belief, it's something in my thinking
it's not a fantasy, if you stick with us yeah we will set you free
it's not a far commute to access the company of brighter pigments
it's not a free state
it's not a fucking war
it's not a great plan but we like the agenda
it's not a law enforcement issue,
it's not a lot but it ain't noise pollution baby
it's not a material thing
it's not a matter of laws
it's not a matter of rights
it's not a movement, it's just another fad
it's not a new concept on mtv
it's not a plan, it's not a blueprint,
it's not a prank, no it's our society contaminating your dreams
it's not a rebel cry of some socialist scheme to push for human rights
it's not a scam girl

it's not okay and you're not free to be a different way
it's not our media, it's their fucking media,
it's not over yet i can resist chasing you
it's not part of the plan,
it's not politics i'm trying to annihilate
it's not religion but we think we're on a mission
it's not safe being free, can't give back what you feel
it's not something a person can plan
it's not something new to me a body in the street free publicity
it's not the fall of your empire the end of your world
it's not the music, it's the lack of movement
it's not the secret of the government
it's not the usual situation of the average media lies
it's not the way it's supposed to be, the flames of love only set you free
it's not to help you, but help their cause, under one system, you wont exist
it's not what you'd call a riot
it's not what's called society
it's not working and the rules have already changed
it's not worth fighting, just resist
it's nothin, i'm from new york but i got country cousins
it's nothing but facism, capitalism, and fear
it's nothing more than a political weapon
it's nothing new to break the rules and be a suicide
it's now 3:21 pm on the planet demon8
it's now become a struggle for the middle-class to survive
it's off and i'm free!!
it's often been said that truth is the first casualty of war,
it's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat
it's ok, your war has died, but the battle still goes on outside
it's okay the rest of us heal the pain now we're free to say
it's on fire, it's my empire
it's on now, no rules we obeying
it's on the radio, it's on the tv news
it's on to victory or under ground
it's on your tv all over the news
it's one and all, defend your fate, your destiny can be
it's one country but two people, nothing but animosity,
it's one fantastic planet
it's one great big conspiracy
it's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
it's one more and i'm free,
it's one of nature's laws
it's one struggle - it's one fight
it's one struggle, one fight
it's one thing to be free from sin
it's only another obstacle blocking any chance of equality
it's only feelings though i can't resist
it's only getting worse contrary to the politicians lies
it's only mind pollution
it's only mission is killing everything
it's only one opinion, right or wrong
it's only right i set you free
it's only society that tells you that that's the way that is true
it's only you that can set me free
it's only you that makes me free
it's only your democracy
it's order of oume at tuil
it's our culture and consumption that makes her life unbearable
it's our destiny to make the cold war history
it's our generation that ought to feel shame
it's our generation, baby
it's our generation, yeah
it's our last chance to defend
it's our lasting liberty-the freedom to succumb,
it's our mission to seek our enemies and kill them one by one
it's our nation, we were living for the day
it's our nature to be adversarial and free
it's our plan, strike a match
it's our prison, final reason for the freedom and the glory that we feel
it's our private war
it's our responsibility to keep the system working
it's our rights they're abusing, it's our right to fight back
it's our task to free them
it's our time to be honest, our time to be free
it's our time to make a stand against the rule of the skeleton crown.
it's our victory for darkness
it's over now but you'll never be free
it's over when we're afraid to break the rules
it's over, i'm free from this pain called life
it's overwhelming, the state of mind we're in
it's packaged! it's just fashion and rebellion
it's paralysed by the terror
it's paranoia time and it's time to break the rules
it's part of a plan i'm not feeling so bad
it's part of nature's plan
it's part of the plan they guide your hand
it's part of the war, i'm gonna do right
it's part of yo struggle if it you ain't got shit for me
it's passengers screaming in mob terror.

it's said that our dear scarlet shall never be a puppet
it's said there isn't a political bone
it's sanitized economy
it's sick to stay here, i'm running free
it's silent and deadly long after the mission
it's silly, i'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
it's similar to rhythm nation
it's simply government and british soldiers out not who governs or unity now
it's skatterman, cat, strange music's black sheep. (why?)
it's slow motion, will somebody please press play

it's still your game by your rules
it's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket
it's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
it's succumbed to its own laws
it's such a brutal planet
it's such a long time since the towns flourished. and it was a fertile country
it's such a simple plan
it's sunday morning and like sheep with no shepherd

its your choice, we can be free
it's a state of mind
it's a time to abolish the standards of the weak
it's a time to put question to their rule
it's all about suppressing women's rights with hierarchal control
it's all part of some plan i could never understand
it's an unnatural, corrupt behavior that threatens spirituality and health
it's been the unifying catalyst for country and religion
it's hard to believe she can never set her free screaming why
it's just a state of mind...
it's just like me to plan an escape
it's just my idea of a good government
it's just that i'm not interested in their politics
it's like wading through a wasteland where a town you love once stood
it's me, the chaos sphere that rules this land
it's more acceptable and politically profitable to believe the corrupt f
it's music is the movement

my war (in heaven)' to revile the truth of which we'll follow...
my war - i believe in
my war - just believe in my war...
my war - lie of freedom
my war - scream of pain
my war - word of the beast
my war against all mankind
my war an eye for an eye
my war horse hammering the ground with impatience.
my war is fought by those i have taught
my war my past, my mental faction
my war my soul, my sanity
my war was over but a new one has begun
my war with god is growing strong

my wicked eye - watched planet burn
my wife she is a tyrant around the ??
my will against the law of the universe
my will conforming to the instinct of war
my will for freedom.
my will is my strength, all resistance in vain
my will sets me free
my wine talks to me, talks his voice for free

my world so bright and free
my world, my tv, and my food
my world, you will be trading it for free
my wrists will bleed for one last struggle
my yellow press of guns of death
my yellow press of immoral greed
my yellow stage light smile distracting dancing puppets on short saliva strings
myopia of this self-consuming utopia
myriad in choice, but a selective social view
myron and cole had a plan heading of to another world
myself a kaleidoscope of thoughts that won't set me free
myself deeply sinkin' - free me with your touch
myself from your tyranny
mysery love company, i guess i'ma leave y'all

mystic shine of the timeless tyranny
mystic sounds of your tv - extreme heat of your rack

the low life company bar
the lowest common denominator rules
the lucifer rebellion
the lull of false security
the lungs struggling for breath screaming
the lure of power creates a death trap of social decay
the lust for a new generation,
the lust for blood for god and state
the lust for freedom will see me through, until i break the chain,
the lust for the darkest path to victory
the lusts are your rules
the lying government
the lyrics reflect my frustration a few years back on the whole music industry.
the macabre requiem of the nation
the machine spits blood and lurches into war
the machines are out of order
the machines destroy freedom
the machines were out of order
the machines, machines that burns for war
the machines, machines they pay for war
the mad nuclear missile plans
the maddened crow will spread terror
the madness of oppression onset, insight has now been plagued
the madness of our fathers law
the madness, state of my mind

the magic of the freedom that lies in everyone
the magic set's the spirit free
the magic wand of oppression waves above
the main jefe talks about our freedom
the main problem with war
the maine punx are everywhere, in every fucking state
the mainstream is so polluted with lies
the majority believes
the majority lack one, but its not about backbones
the majority of ears were only being polite
the majority of our kin left this world to begin anew.
the majority of people are treated like shit
the majority of these boys in blue are phony
the making of the plan
the making over requires and order for some surgery
the man at hand that rule the school
the man has a plan to see through
the man in me is ready for war, like holyfield/tyson iv
the man is a mere nothing, he don't can rule
the man is on the tv., in the papers, on the radio
the man next door? your brother in law? who's away working on the oilrigs?
the man of the struggle,
the man on the tv is all you need to see
the man on tv preaches his beliefs to me
the man the authorities came to blame
the man upstairs gotta plan
the man upstairs must have a plan
the man was an icon of generation x
the man who avoids the rules of life
the man who rules the world
the man who spends his life on a mission, he's legendary
the man with a plan and a pocket comb
the man's gunna laugh as your resistance he breaks
the manifest of a change slain
the manifest of your sentence
the manifestation for eternal war.
the manipulation begins...
the manipulation of us all
the many men who've went to war are lost but never found
the map of the existing laws
the march into permanent freedom
the march of chaos - alliteration to order
the marching terror, puify the world
the mark of war is upon me the taste of blood's on my tongue
the market's just collapsed, in a wave of freedom,
the mars ruled aries rules my dreams
the mask of terror engraved on your eyelids
the mask that hides corruption
the mass begins sing familiar hymns,
the mass begins the spirit appears
the mass construction
the mass debate never ends
the mass demand for energy
the mass graved sinners, the no name dead
the mass inflicted cyanide
the mass is driven back
the mass is eternal but its shape goes through changes
the mass is long awaited
the mass is screaming
the mass is the sign of deliverance
the mass it grows larger and larger
the mass menace at ya door like a costume ball (hello)
the mass mutilation of a world ensued,
the mass negotiations in their pointless pleas for sanctions
the mass of blood is a way to love.
the mass of evil is said
the mass of futile prayers
the mass of maggots crawl
the mass of people touches my frozen soul
the mass of praying corpses
the mass of steel begins to rust...
the mass of the primitive oceans
the mass of times, the highpriest's return
the mass requires rotten blood
the mass thought will not survive
the mass was celebrated at a place of blood and destruction
the mass was created in a spirit of greed and corruption
the mass was shouting
the mass will never see
the masses air becomes thicker than the water we drink people unaware
the masses are armed
the masses are asses, a bunch of fools
the masses are eager to follow and to join up with the legions of lies"
the masses are gathered, to watch me as i slip away
the masses are going to battle
the masses are left to ponder
the masses are marching northward.
the masses are numb, their ethics awry.
the masses are obsequious, contented in their sleep
the masses are starving while ministers dine
the masses are swallowed under,
the masses ascend to a golden lie
the masses bewildered, the marked ones avoided
the masses cheer i climb the stairs
the masses cheer, to hide their fears
the masses cling to fallacy without the courage to feeling another way
the masses comatose.
the masses consumed by this culture of greed
the masses cringe in fear for their sentence has arrived
the masses feel good
the masses flee the abyss in awe.
the masses from a distance
the masses gather 'round
the masses gather for another look
the masses have been hypnotized
the masses have fallen.
the masses have grown
the masses have taken them
the masses hinged on the stroke of a knife.
the masses inside of us suffering they are bleeding,
the masses is your goal
the masses may reject me for i don't belong to the majority
the masses meld, the titans come, a crowd torn asunder
the masses met their fate
the masses muffled cries wail
the masses needs remain the same
the masses of disturbed, and they're looking at me
the masses of humanity have always had to suffer
the masses of humanity have always, always had to suffer!
the masses of humanity will always have to suffer
the masses of humanity, still clinging to their dignity,
the masses of people are on the road
the masses of sacred flesh twisting
the masses of sleepers fear it in part on account of these historical examples
the masses of unscarred.
the masses of worms. they swarm in torso
the masses revolt as vexation grows
the masses roar to hear, sounds of thunderous song
the masses screamed and called for help
the masses seek and swallows lies and saviours
the masses shall follow their leader, praise the new world order
the masses slave it while the masters feast.
the masses that teem below them
the masses they can't relate
the masses they decide the fate of a fallen men.
the masses walk towards the oppressive warmth of the fire.
the masses watch and stand by
the masses were assured, she fought without a sword.
the masses will abide
the masses will embrace, all the lies that they will speak
the masses will not try it unless they see it put to action!
the masses will rip your mind
the masses, immature
the masses, one machine
the masses, so deaf and blind
the masses, they're calling him blade
the masses, towards inhalation
the massive corporations turning political thumbscrews
the massive wooden factory tonight my calling answered
the master and the puppet in the show
the master of space, time and war
the master of the plan wrappin shit like saran
the master plan is now complete
the master plan is old to life.
the master plan is set in motion
the master plan is yours and living with knowledge is hell
the master plan should be rearranged
the master plan. we must preserve
the master rule supreme!
the master stands, in front of the altar, his name is terror.
the masterminds all break the rules
the masterplan defeasted by the laws of earth's beliefs
the masters of manipulation
the masters of terror reign further with blasphemy
the material cause of the universe of names and forms i perceive
the material in each and empty thoughts
the material put out by monsters
the material sphere bursts
the material will become the entry
the material world seems to me like a newspaper headline-
the mating call of war
the mayhemic tales of terror
the mayor, the president, the cardinal
the maze of the free
the meaning of life discovered in a secondary state
the meaning of this tide of decadence
the measure and code - the law of the knights
the mechanoid is out of order
the media all twist the facts
the media always wants the exclusive
the media and "our" leaders wrap it all up in a flag- their fucking shit-rag
the media and now they're
the media and popular demand
the media and their social cliques - they lie, they lie
the media be tryin to make a nigga look bad, whassup with that?
the media brainwashed me to love pursuit of things
the media brainwashed us all you see
the media cares cause the media knows

the sheep are dominated by the fear
the sheep are gathered
the sheep are grazing
the sheep are hypocrites,
the sheep are made to follow
the sheep are quick to believe
the sheep are told to divide
the sheep begin to drop
the sheep could not dream
the sheep leaves the flock, i lost another friend
the sheep march to the fire and wait to host the flies

the sheep retain their wish
the sheep who follow him there gather
the sheep will always sleep until retired
the sheep will drown in blood and pain
the sheep without the shepherd evermore

the shooting company of captain frans b. cocq
the sick in his soul, exanding within, yearns to be free
the sick manifestations of raised security
the sickening smell of war

the skies will turn black for my order
the skim and the scam
the sky clad flocks a carnal war,
the sky is a new shade of war
the sky is blue and offers freedom,
the sky is falling on a tv screen. mass hysteria for an american dream.
the sky laughs loud, entertainment for free
the slaughter is a necessary means of total war, merciless
the slave of hunger, now enjoy being free
the slave rules the king
the slayer of apep casts the old structures down
the sleeper has awakened now our justice will be done
the slightest guilt for free.
the slogan on the tv says just do it

the stench of death in every nation,
the stench of global furnace
the stench of mass complacency
the stench of war can be smelled
the stiller the oxygen the harder you breathe
the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law
the sting of dejection nestled in conformity

the streets a battle, revolution fulfilled
the streets are plastered with their propaganda
the streets lost it's freedom to be crossed
the streets our schools defiance rules
the streets run with blood from the mass mutilation
the streets there's rules
the streets turned into a mass grave
the streets, the cops, the system, harrassment (uh-huh)

the struggle ain't right up in your face, it's more subtle
the struggle and sacrifice.
the struggle and the fight
the struggle appear to be infinite
the struggle continues
the struggle continues as the cries of pain
the struggle continues at the of pain
the struggle ends up here!
the struggle for a treasure

the struggle we're engaged in -
the struggle will go on as long as you keep fighting
the struggle with yourself
the struggle within archaic desire, claim your right and devour
the struggle you've been into
the struggle's about freedom, not who is going to win it
the struggle, baby, has just begun
the struggle, my great grand who lived thru the linchin'
the struggle, the battle, the fight for time
the struggling layman, the lazy lush
the struggling of finding the truth behind the lies
the struggling souls, seeking the spirit
the stuff for modern media lore
the stupid sheep turn theis head to the blind!
the subconscious terror rules
the subtle hijacking of freedom leaves the common injury

the suicidal terrorist is the new idol
the sum of every nation
the sun beams down on a brand new day
the sun brought terror straight
the sun doesn't admit me in his empire,
the sun enlightens the plains where victory was won
the sun falls on my eyes and i'm struggling to reason why everybody smiles
the sun is shining on a brand new day
the sun never sets on the empire won
the sun no longer sets me free
the sun sets on the war,
the sun sets us free
the sun turned cold over president street and the town of the brooklyn mourned
the sun will never rise, darkness will rule supreme.
the sun will rise up, and you'll be in freedom
the sun's warmth will set you free
the sunset paints shades on his face, sea-gulls fly free
the suppression of each generation
the supreme state is death
the surface of the planet. the shape of the stars
the surprise is part of the movement,
the survival structures of my soul
the survivors are numbered amongst the dead
the survivors are suffocated by the reek of spoilage
the survivors might see the night
the survivors of a dead world,
the survivors of the battle against chaos to one final act of defiance...
the survivors searching for the light
the swan song of a nation,
the swan was in her movement
the swarming infected mass discovered
the sweat of the industry secret handshake
the sweet tv with the vcr
the swift turns of war
the swirling nuclear chaos
the sword of justice will vanguish this sea of
the sword of lies he takes to war
the sword of war will plunder with might - cardassia in ruins
the sword will bring us glory, our freedom is assured
the swords of justice
the swords, and axes of the rebels, are drenched with blood...

the system makes its money off you
the system makes sure that the boot goes in
the system malfunctioning
the system medicates them
the system might have got you but it won't get me
the system mounted on the wall
the system moves to slow
the system needs its servants, each birth is one more
the system needs to wipe ou the thinking and loving
the system never really cared
the system of ruling was based on lies
the system of strings are breakin' your wings
the system of terror
the system perfected and complete
the system rapes you
the system refused you

the system steals your soul
the system still remains adjourned
the system stinks and we all know it
the system stopped sponsoring me
the system tells me what to think
the system that is coming up will really end this hell
the system that plays us
the system they didn't understand
the system took me in but then they took me under
the system wants me to be
the system we learn says we're equal under law
the system will beat your life
the system will fall on its knees and we'll rule the world
the system will use any amount of force to uphold its strength and power
the system you despised now controls you
the system you ride, the system you fight

und all die liebe war vergebens als h'tt das meer sie weggesp'hlt
und als ich endlich da war,
und am ende fragen wir uns was das denn war
und auch der nabel war versteckt vom haar
und auch sein abgang war kaum mehr zu toppen.
und aus der jukebox erklang musik die fremd und s'dlich war
und bald denkt keiner mehr daran wie es hier war
und das was fr'her einmal wichtig war,
und der glanz des morgens war wunder, wundersch'n
und der kleine das war ich
und die erde steht in brand
und die nacht war schwarz und ohne fenster
und die wut noch nicht geboren war,
und es war schon ein wenig ewigkeit
und freud war er in meinen mund
und gesegnet war ihr todesmarsch
und gestern war mir 'bler
und ich war sofort verliebt
und ihr n'rgelt, ohne eine revolution zu wollen
und irgendwann fasst er den plan
und jede tr'ne kostbar war.
und jeder neue tag voller farben war
und kaum war der tag verstrichen,
und lang und schwarz war ihr haar
und legt sie vor das klavier. es war sien letzter trommelschlag. (damals
und liebte eine j'din gar als er noch quietschlebendig war.
und micha war ein guter kerl,
und mit einem mal war ihm alles klar,
und morgens wei't du er war hier.
und nachts oft schreit - war wohl bekannt
und nachts war ich bei dir
und nichts war so wie's voher war
und nichts wird mehr so sein, wie es gestern noch war
und nur die nacht war zeuge
und ob terror legitim sein kann, im ernst, ich wei' es nicht
und obwohl ich doch so grausam war
und schei' auf das, was vorher war
und sein spielplatz war der stra'enstaub
und sie wissen gleich wer's war
und so leicht war dein gang,
und so wie es einmal war
und stimmt es doch, und euch war nichts bekannt
und trinkst auf den versager, der erneut zu feige war
und trotz der fl'che und des zorns war platz f'r frohe worte
und verbrannt war alles geld
und war doch einst davon besessen
und war ein feiner herr.
und war erschrocken fast
und war es an der zeit, dann warteten wir schon
und war geruhrt und tief bewegt
und war mein leben nur leid
und war nicht mehr l'nger verborgen im dunkel
und was er sah war armut und not
und was ich sah war dummheit
und was ich sah war menschlichkeit...
und wie oft war ich schon hier
und wir z'hlen die stunden bis zur revolution

within my burning empire
within my mist filled eyes, utopia lies
within my state, there exists much hate
within the authoritarian society.
within the limits of the system
within the screaming system a burning fever hides
within the sterile environment that carries out american retribution
within the system range
within the wandering herd, sheep of the sang real,
within the winter full moon gloom, where global frost endeavours
within the wreckage of a civilization
within these walls is where i'm free
within this dark system decay
within this darkened globe of mounting terror
within this revolution.

without struggle or misery
without struggle there is no strength
without struggle, man is no longer man
without the action you're pushing it to the next -- generation
without the anger resistance can't break these chains
without the battle, without their struggle
without the oxygen i need
without the reign of terror over every momentary change
without the sentence structure
without the sorrow (i'll be free)
without the war the peace would never exist!!
without the world upon our tv
without their order and their money policy
without them our country would be run by the commies
without this civilization
without thoughts to rule.
without throbs on the judge's order,
without victory i will now declare war against you
without war and pain
without war, without games
